The strike caused significant damage to the chancery building; no American personnel were present following the ordered departure. On the same day, in one of the most jarring friendly fire incidents of the war, a Kuwaiti Air Force F/A-18C Hornet intercepting incoming Iranian missiles shot down three U.S. Air Force F-15E Strike Eagles near the Kuwaiti-Iraqi border. The Kuwaiti pilots had misidentified the F-15Es as Iranian cruise missiles in the dense airspace. All six U.S. crew members ejected and survived, recovered by Kuwaiti search-and-rescue helicopters. The incident prompted an immediate stand-down review of Gulf coalition deconfliction protocols.",

Investigations by CNN, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and BBC Verify concluded the U.S. was likely responsible, with analysts attributing the strike to outdated DIA targeting data that had misidentified the school compound as a nearby IRGC logistics facility. The school's location in Minab — near Bandar Abbas — placed it within a zone of dense targeting activity on Day 1. The strike drew widespread international condemnation and was raised at an emergency UN Security Council session called by Russia and China. The U.S. Department of Defense declined to confirm or deny responsibility, citing an ongoing investigation.",

BBC Verify and New York Times munitions analysts identified the weapon based on distinctive canard fin fragments recovered at the scene and the airburst detonation pattern visible in drone footage. Lamerd sits roughly 60 km inland from the coast and is near no known military installation, suggesting a targeting error or GPS spoofing of the guidance system.
